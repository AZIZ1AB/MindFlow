# 🧠 MindFlow — Early Depression Risk Detection

MindFlow is an AI-powered mental health check-in web application that detects early signs of depression through natural conversation and a trained machine learning classifier.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

MindFlow conducts a gentle 5-question conversation with the user, generates a first-person summary of their mental state, and passes it through a fine-tuned DistilBert binary classifier to predict depression risk level (LOW or MEDIUM). Based on the result, personalized recommendations are provided.

## 🤖 Models Used

| Model | Role | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Llama 3.3 70B (Groq) | Conversation + Summary generation | Groq API (free) |
| DistilBert fine-tuned | Depression risk classification | HuggingFace |

### Classifier
- **Model:** `amaranceur/mentalhhealthclassifier`
- **Architecture:** DistilBertForSequenceClassification
- **Labels:** `LABEL_0` → LOW risk, `LABEL_1` → MEDIUM risk
- **Input:** First-person summary of conversation (min 5 sentences)
- **Hosted on:** HuggingFace Space `StryCatt/mindflow-classifier`

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Step 1 — Conversation
Groq's Llama 3.3 70B model conducts a 5-question mental health check-in asking about:
- Mood and emotional state
- Sleep quality
- Energy levels
- Social life
- Daily routine and concentration

### Step 2 — Summary Generation
After 5 exchanges, Groq generates a detailed first-person summary (minimum 5 sentences) covering all aspects of the user's mental state.

### Step 3 — Classification
The summary is sent to the fine-tuned DistilBert classifier hosted on HuggingFace Spaces. It returns:
- `LOW` — Preventive guidance recommended
- `MEDIUM` — Active support recommended

### Step 4 — Recommendations
Based on the risk level, the app displays personalized recommendations from 4 categories:
- 🟢 **Relaxation & Mindfulness** — Breathing, meditation, yoga
- 🟡 **Lifestyle Balance** — Sleep hygiene, physical activity
- 🔵 **Social Connection** — Reaching out to friends and family
- 🟣 **Professional Support** — Therapists, counselors, crisis helplines
